# Can of Books

**Author**: Ezgi, Chris
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

This assignment is a digital bookshelf where you are able to store your favorite books. This would also allow your book to be stored in a database, which would make them able to be added to or deleted.

## Getting Started

There must be an initial server built with valid end points. Alongside a front end where You do have various bootstrap components accessible (like forms and modals) These forms (modal) would take in the value of the input and send them to our active server/ database and store these items, where they are accesible to create and delete.

## Architecture

This app was heavily built around JS, React, Mongoose, and Express

## Change Log

10-22-2022 3:59pm - Deployed on netlify -->
10-25 -2022 we created access to mongoose and mongo db, we also created our schema and built several front end components that would allow access to the back end components.
10-26-22 We added react modal which would act as a landing pad for our form, which makes the adding to our DB possible.
