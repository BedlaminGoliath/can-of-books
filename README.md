### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?

### Cooperative

- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.  
    Chris: comfortable with React, good at communication, flexible with time, good at researching solutions.
    Ezgi: troubleshooting, logic, proof-reading, open to improvement.

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?  
    Relying on eachother's strengths and combining them for a successful result. 
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?  
    Chris: get better with logic and proofreading.
    Ezgi: get better with communication and researching to find solutions.
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?  
    Doing a stand-up before we start working, be honest about tasks and our understanding of them. Taking turns pair programming as driver and navigator. Look ahead for plans the next day. 

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?  
    Communicate with each other, if not successful reach out to Hexx. 
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?  
    Same as above. 
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?  
    Switch roles if necessaty during paired-programming, help each other understand concepts we are trying to implement.
